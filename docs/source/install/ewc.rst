StackStorm is an event-driven DevOps automation platform with all the essential features suitable
for small businesses and teams. Itâ€™s free and open source under the Apache 2.0 license.

support, advanced features such as fine-tuned access control, LDAP, and Workflow Designer. To

You can also add Network Automation Suites on top of an |ewc| system. See
`ewc-docs.extremenetworks.com/solutions/overview.html <https://ewc-docs.extremenetworks.com/solutions/overview.html>`_
to learn more.

Quick Evaluation
----------------

To install |ewc| for a quick evaluation, run the commands below on a clean 64-bit Linux box that
meets the :doc:`/install/system_requirements`. Replace ``${EWC_LICENSE_KEY}`` with the key you
received when registering for evaluation or purchasing EWC.

.. code-block:: bash

  curl -sSL -O https://stackstorm.com/bwc/install.sh && chmod +x install.sh
  ./install.sh --user=st2admin --password='Ch@ngeMe' --license=${EWC_LICENSE_KEY}

Upgrading from Community
------------------------

Already have a working StackStorm system, and want to add |ewc|? No problem! No need to install a
new system. You can install |ewc| on top of your existing system. Just run these commands, again
replacing ``${EWC_LICENSE_KEY}`` with the license key you received when registering:

* On Ubuntu systems:

  .. code-block:: bash

    # Set up Extreme Workflow Composer repository access
    curl -s https://${EWC_LICENSE_KEY}:@packagecloud.io/install/repositories/StackStorm/enterprise/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
    # Install Extreme Workflow Composer
    sudo apt-get install -y bwc-enterprise

* On RedHat/CentOS systems:

  .. code-block:: bash

    # Set up Extreme Workflow Composer repository access
    curl -s https://${EWC_LICENSE_KEY}:@packagecloud.io/install/repositories/StackStorm/enterprise/script.rpm.sh | sudo bash
    # Install Extreme Workflow Composer
    sudo yum install -y bwc-enterprise

.. note::

    After installing the package and configuring st2.conf you need to restart ``st2api`` and
    ``st2auth`` service for RBAC and LDAP backend changes (if configured) to take an effect -
    ``sudo st2ctl restart``.

To understand the full details of the installation procedure, or to install |ewc| manually, follow
the installation guide for your Linux version: :doc:`/install/deb`, :doc:`/install/rhel7`, or
:doc:`/install/rhel6`. It will walk you through installing and configuring StackStorm and |ewc|.
The last step of the instructions is "Upgrade to |ewc|".
